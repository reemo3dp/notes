# Reemo's 3D Printing Notes

I'm a software engineer who got into 3d printing in 2021 with an *Anycubic i3 Mega S*. Since then I've moved on to klipper on a *Kingroon KP3S V3*, a *Sovol SV06* and a *Siboor Voron V0.2 R1*.

Consider any confidence I have regarding **software** justified, on the grounds that I'm terrified about software and been working with it too long.

Consider any confidence I have regarding **hardware** wildly exaggerated and a sign of hybris if any, on the grounds that I'm terrified about hardware and haven't had professional training in it.
