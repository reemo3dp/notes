# BME680 / CJMCU-680 as a chamber temperature sensor with VOC gas measure

Connected with i2c address `0x77` (`119`) on `i2c3` of the Gemini MCU (`SBC_transfer` is `SDA`, `LCD-D5` is `SCL`, borrow `3.3V` from `STLINK`).

Temperature and humidity reading seemed plausible, raw gas resistance responds to ABS printing, but the raw value isn't very useful.
