# Reemo's Build Guide

This is the idealistic process I'm following (when people ask) when working on electronics.

## Guiding Principles

- No multimeter, no build
- Every guide is outdated and wrong - Take them for a checklist of things to do, but don't do them as they say.
- The schematics and the pinout is the only digital source of truth that an be trusted until you find out it's wrong
- Every wire needs to be traced from source to target and be in agreement with the schematics.

## Checklist before first power-on


!!! warning 
    This is a non-exhaustive list of checks!

- [ ] Power supply has the correct input voltage (`110v` vs `230v`) set
- [ ] All polarities are correct (*duh*)

## Checklist after first power-on
